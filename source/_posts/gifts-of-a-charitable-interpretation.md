my co-worker Greg introduced me (and our team) to a useful concept: _being charitable (or not) with how you interpret someone_.

## how to be charitable

the background for this concept is in philosophy: the [Principle of Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity), which says that before you argue _against_ someone, you should build up their argument to be as **strong** as possible.

applying this to a social context: before we give someone negative feedback, we should assume the best possible intentions.

## the prime directive

in the context of agile retrospectives, we see this concept as [The Prime Directive](http://www.retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive)

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

when we assume good faith, we are able to go beyond blaming any person involved and instead focus on the systems we are in.

## signs you are not being charitable

sometimes we aren't charitable. it happens, we're human!

for me, i'm trying to recognize when i'm not being charitable so i can learn from my mistakes.

so, you are probably not being charitable if

- you back up your interpretation with pre-existing tension or conflicts
- you nitpick words or assume you would have a better interpretation with the right words

## charity loops

by being charitable, we are able to appreciate our interpretations in union rather than in difference.

when we expect the best of people and give them trust, they will feel empowered to be trustworthy and give us abundance.
