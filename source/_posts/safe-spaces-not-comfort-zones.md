# safe spaces not comfort zones

some months ago, my work family Root Systems had a cultural problem: our so-called _safe space_ was really a _comfort zone_!

## what is a comfort zone?

a comfort zone is where you avoid FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), stress, or situational anxiety.

as a chaotic creature, my comfort zone is probably larger than most.  my comfort zone is...

from The Prophet:

> And tell me, people of Orphalese, what have you in these houses?
> And what is it you guard with fastened doors?
> Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power?
> Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that spans the summits of the mind?
> Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood and stone to the holy fountain?
> Tell me, have you these in your houses?
> Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enteres the hous a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master?
> 
> Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.
> Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron
> It lulls you to sleep oly to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh,
> It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels
> Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.

## what is a safe space?

a safe space is where you're safe to be vulnerable, maybe even uncomfortable! ([tweet](TODO))

a safe space is where you are encouraged to be your authentic self amongst others who care about your well-being.

even in the safest of spaces, people make mistakes, situations may become tense, conflicts may arise, work may be tough, it's okay!

## how to welcome discomfort

our comfort is a privilege, not an entitlement.

when we stay within our comfort zone, we enable our weaknesses at the expense of hinder personal growth.

paradoxically, to become a better person we want to choose to be uncomfortable, to face our fears directly.

we won't find our best self in our comfort zone, it will be found in the (sometimes uncomfortable) safe space!
