# safe spaces not comfort zones

some months ago, my work family Root Systems had a cultural problem: our so-called _safe space_ was really a _comfort zone_!

## what is a comfort zone

your comfort zone is a momentary feeling away from fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

> And tell me, people of Orphalese, what have you in these houses?
> And what is it you guard with fastened doors?
> Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power?
> Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that spans the summits of the mind?
> Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood and stone to the holy fountain?
> Tell me, have you these in your houses?
Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enteres the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master?
> 
> Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.
> Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron
> It lulls you to sleep oly to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh,
> It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels
> Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.

## what is a safe space

> a safe spaces is where you're safe to be vulnerable, maybe even uncomfortable! <3
>
> the nuance is a critique on the idea that a "safe space" is free of any discomfort, stress, or situational anxiety. this is a healthy part of being your authentic self in a real (working) environment :sunny: :house_with_garden: :blush:

## how to welcome discomfort

when we stay within our comfort zone, we enable our weaknesses at the expense of hinder personal growth.

paradoxically, we want to choose to be uncomfortable

## how to disable your weaknesses

safety is a privilege, not an entitlement

you sometimes have to do things that you don't want to do, a tough situation.
