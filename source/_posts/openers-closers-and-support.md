title: 'openers, closers, and support'

once upon a team, we've had a reflection: it's unfair to expect everyone to do the same work equally (homogeneity), instead the total work is spread across many complementary roles (heterogeneity).

to help us towards this understanding, Greg shared the typical formation of a Counter Strike team:

- openers: those who explore new opportunities
- closers: those who exploit existing opportunities
- support: those who provide supplementary help to openers or closers

## team dynamics

with this mindset, it's unfair to expect someone who is a better closer to start a project from scratch. it's also unfair to expect someone who is a better opener to do the long-tail work on delivering a project. etc

to generalize this mindset, everyone has an abundance of skills to offer. how do we match complementary skills together to advance our shared mission? how do we provide the support everyone needs to be their best?

## me for example

for me, i'm a great opener. i love doing proof-of-concepts! for example, started the [scuttlebutt.nz](https://scuttlebutt.nz) website, the [pull-stream.github.io](http://pull-stream.github.io/) website, did early work to start [patchcore](http://github.com/ssbc/patchcore), recently started [butt-as-a-service](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/butt-as-a-service), did something silly with [ssb-bot](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/ssb-bot).

but i'm terrible at making things _great_. i only get so far as _good enough_ and then i've moved on to the next exciting problem to solve.

also i'm confident enough to ramble my stream-of-consciousness in front of a bunch of strangers, like this, weeeeee talking too much is easy for me!

but if everyone was like me, we'd have a bad time. same with anyone here who is considered "great". we need a balanced group of people, each doing complementary work, each supporting our shared mission together.

## homework

so, when i arrive at a project, i'm most interested in asking the questions:

- who is available for doing work here?
- what role do you want to embody?
- what support do you need to be at your best?
- how do you want to be held accountable for your work?
