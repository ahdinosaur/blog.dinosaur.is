in the last year, i've noticed two seas of (white) moderates: one as a valuable bridge, another as a deceiving infection.

for context, i come from the United States of America, where many of my extended family and friends may support Donald Trump and may be on the spectrum of the Alt-Right, it's not possible for me to ignore the new waves of moderate politics.

at some point a distinct difference came to light, i'd like to share what i've learned about moderates, good and bad.

## what is a [moderate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moderate)?

a _moderate_ is a person whose opinions are not extreme, whose beliefs fall in the middle between any two sides.

often, moderate are those who have the most privilege, who benefit most from the status quo, and who are the most tolerated.

on the flip side, being a moderate is not a practical strategy for those who suffer from the status quo, who are part of marginalized communities, and who are actively intolerated.

however, i do believe being a moderate is a useful strategy when used as a bridge to connect diversity. whether i think a moderate is good or bad depends on whether they are connecting or disconnecting diverse opinions and beliefs.

## good moderates are empathetic of diverse beliefs

if you're able to empathize with diverse beliefs from all sides, you're a good moderate.

being empathetic means you are able to share an experience in solidarity with another person or group.

i first noticed this quality in [Dominic Tarr](http://dominictarr.com), author of [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz), when reading [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/meet-the-counterantidisintermediationists/527553/)

> In an age awash with venture capitalists and billionaires, anarcho-capitalists and conspiracy theorists, oligarchs and neo-authoritarians, perhaps the most compelling vision of the technological future is also the most modest. Scuttlebutt offers one model of that humility. Diverse groups of people networked in equally diverse, and even mutually-contradictory ways—for profit, for community, for anarchy, for globalism, and for localism, among others. No revolution whatsoever. Just people of all stripes, in places of all kinds, who sometimes use computers together.

support diverse movements, not co-opt! (All Lives Matter)

## bad moderates are skeptical of diverse beliefs

if you're skepitcal of diverse beliefs from any side, you're a bad moderate.

being skeptical means you judge the experience of another person or group.

Martin Luther King, Jr. had some words to say in a ["Letter from a Birmingham Jail"](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) (16 April 1963):

> First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season". Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

if you're [waiting for the perfect protest](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/opinion/civil-rights-protest-resistance.html), you're a bad moderate.

### case study: NFL kneels

some time ago, a football player [Colin Kaepernick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick) started a movement by kneeling, instead of standing, during the national anthem.

in an interview after the game, Kaepernick gave a clear meaning to his unique expression:

> I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.

from then on, game after game, this unique expression of kneeling was used in public events to remind the audience about the message of institutional violence against black people.

as someone seeing this happen, we're not being asked to agree or disagree, we're being reminded of another group's experiences. the kneeling is a reminded, lest we forget, that the public system is unjust for some people.

yet, in my extended network i became witness to skepticism, with articles such as ["Quit grandstanding with NFL protests and get back to football"](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/09/26/fl-stop-self-destructive-grandstanding-and-just-play-football-james-robbins-column/701472001/).

> Sports used to be fun, but these protests are divisive and pointless. Can't we just play ball?

rather than being empathetic with another group's experience, i noticed [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)
