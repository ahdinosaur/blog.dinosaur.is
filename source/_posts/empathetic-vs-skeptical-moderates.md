in the last year, i've noticed two seas of (white) moderates: one as a valuable bridge, another as an infection of deception.

for context, i come from the United States of America, where many of my extended family and friends may support Donald Trump and may be on the spectrum of the Alt-Right, it's not possible for me to ignore the new waves of moderate politics.

at some point a distinction came to light, so i'd like to share what i've learned about moderates, good and bad.

## what is a [moderate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moderate)?

a _moderate_ is a person whose opinions are not extreme, whose beliefs fall in the middle between any two sides.

often, moderate are those who have the most privilege, who benefit most from the status quo, and who are the most tolerated.

on the flip side, being a moderate is not a applicable strategy for those who suffer from the status quo, who are part of marginalized communities, and who are actively intolerated.

however, i do believe being a moderate is a useful strategy when used as a bridge to connect diversity. whether i think a moderate is good or bad depends on whether they are connecting or disconnecting other sides.



## good moderates are empathetic of diverse beliefs

if you're able to empathize with beliefs from diverse sides, yay!

being empathetic means listening to another person or group's lived experience and standing in solidarity with that experience as being valid.

## bad moderates are skeptical of diverse beliefs

if you're skepitcal of beliefs from diverse sides, boo!

being skeptical means you judge the experience of another person or group.

Martin Luther King, Jr. had some words to say in a ["Letter from a Birmingham Jail"](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) (16 April 1963):

> First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season". Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

if you're [waiting for the perfect protest](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/opinion/civil-rights-protest-resistance.html), please consider that everyone wants to do their best, but only those with privilege have the choice to opt-out of social justice.

### case study: NFL kneels

some time ago, a football player [Colin Kaepernick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick) started a movement by kneeling, instead of standing, during the national anthem.

[![Buffalo Bills players take a knee prior to a game against the Oakland Raiders in Orchard Park, N.Y., on Oct. 29. (credit Adrian Krausâ€”AP/Shutterstock)](https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/adrian-kraus-national-anthem-top-100-photos-2017.jpg?quality=85&w=1000)](http://time.com/top-100-photos-of-2017/)

in an interview after the game, Kaepernick gave a clear meaning to his unique expression:

> I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.

from then on, game after game, this unique expression of kneeling was used in public events to remind the audience about the message of institutional violence against black people.

as someone seeing this happen, we're not being asked to agree or disagree, we're being reminded of another group's experiences. the kneeling is a reminder, lest we forget, that the public system is unjust for some people.

yet, in my extended network i became witness to skepticism, with articles such as ["Quit grandstanding with NFL protests and get back to football"](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/09/26/fl-stop-self-destructive-grandstanding-and-just-play-football-james-robbins-column/701472001/).

> Sports used to be fun, but these protests are divisive and pointless. Can't we just play ball?

rather than being empathetic with another group's experience, i noticed [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting).

but not all (white) moderates were dismissive:

## moderate strategy: be a bridge

as [the personal is political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political), being a moderate with empathy is where we have an opportunity to affect positive social change, using our day-to-day interactions amongst our friends, family, co-workers, and strangers to be a bridge.

for example, here's my friend [Dominic Tarr](http://dominictarr.com) working to bridge the gap between conflicting sides during [a tense conversation on Scuttlebutt](https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25dRuGqDTklt1VqHOEcdJkwgbUrMyELenSCscSbGz%2B8KQ%3D.sha256):

> @marina this isn't just some random dickwad, this dickwad is @mixmix's dad. That is why I think it's worth mediating, for better or worse, he's basically family. @substack is addressing future ssb members, but I'm interesting in addressing the people who are _currently here_. Because one time _you_ told me that one of the challenges facing feminism is that the default response my men is to be skeptical of whatever a woman says, but believe things that other men say. This was surprising at the time, but I soon realized you where right. So you told me that it wasn't enough for women to argue for feminism - men like me had to as well, because other men would actually listen to me. That is what I'm trying to do here.
> <br />
> @bob as you can see, my friends are a bit upset by this, and now you are connected to and socialising in the same space with them. I can certainly vouch that they are highly intelligent and there are many reasons they believe what they do. Could you please take that into consideration? they are not "some segments of some societies" they are a segment of _this_ society.  
> <br />
> I think it's worth bridging between these viewpoints, because I realized that my own views have changed significantly over the years. If my 18 year old self came on here and what I believed at the time, I'd have gotten blasted by current @substack too, and that would be fair enough, but that probably would have galvanized my views not changed them. So I believe that if my views can change, other's views can change too.

to be a good moderate is to listen, to give a voice to those who aren't being heard (or can't be present), to be a connecting link between diverse sides, to support a [diversity of tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_of_tactics) brought by each participant given their understanding of the local situation.


## moderate strategy: be an ally

there are social justice movements happening around us, _be an ally_!

as a person with privilege, it's easy to join a movement with good intentions, but negative impact. notice how much attention you give or take. check if you are supporting or co-opt-ing. above all, listen!

[!["As an ally, I'm not going to pretend to be a superhero. I am going to ask you how I can help" - William C. Anderson, community organizer, DREAMer ally](http://dreamersadrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/allies.jpg)](http://dreamersadrift.com/featured1/the-ally-code-of-conduct)

on the other side,

notice how much you're listening, how much you're talking

don't expect other people to educate you, educate yourself, ask good questions.

> I tell people to fuck off because I think that without stern social repurcussions, people causing harm will continue to stew in their own ignorance. There are otherwise few consequences for otherwise privledged people to maintain toxic beliefs that hurt people.

[@substack](@9nTgtYmvW4HID6ayt6Icwc8WZxdifx5SlSKKIX/X/1g=.ed25519) i hear you that it's important to have stern social repercussions for privileged behavior that negatively impacts people, especially marginalized populations. i'm reminded of the great conversation in %Z8dJFeoxtOQh1hWfO/1oc1FrICX9rBYieD1djhd/zxg=.sha256.

i share [@mix](@ye+QM09iPcDJD6YvQYjoQc7sLF/IFhmNbEqgdzQo3lQ=.ed25519)'s concern that telling people to "get fucked" often leads them to "other" you, and therefore double down on their ignorance. i've seen this happen across my extended family and childhood friends.

from my experience social pressure only has an effect when the recipient of the pressure respects you. this is why i'm most interested in how to better understand the underlying narratives, assumptions, and mindsets behind why people are becoming ignorant, so that we can speak to them in their own language about why their opinion is not beneficial even for them. personally, i don't think any strategy which excludes the (ignorant) masses is a good strategy for mass coordination.

in a parallel context: as a man speaking to other men, i can speak about how the patriarchy sucks for men. how i was conditioned in society to suppress my emotions, reducing my ability to communicate effectively and be healthy. etc.

in this context, i'm interested in how this [false equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence) between Nazis and Antifa is so easy to swallow and regurgitate on demand. especially since my shallow understanding of how Nazism came to power says it involved a very similar meme against the "violent counter-protesters" of the time. as i understand the problem, the more that people feel Antifa are bad source of violence, the more they feel they have something in common with Nazis who are sharing the same narrative.

this also isn't the first time i've encountered the "violent protester" as "domestic terrorist" meme. i remember some beautiful peaceful protests in Oakland and Berkeley, only to be portrayed on the news as "violent [black bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc) destroys city", which my aunt was happy to re-broadcast as an justification for why the protests were bad for the city.

> from the Antifa folks to the Nazi's

[@jer](@uf3kajfhBC2Sd3OysKB5LnBLJ5pwgBhBpXnGEGzgG6A=.ed25519) i appreciate you starting this thread, even though i disagree with your false equivalence between Nazis and Antifa, i understand the position i'm hearing that "all violence is bad no matter what" (which many of my friends in real-life share).

do you think violence is appropriate in the case of self-defense?

> i share @mix's concern that telling people to "get fucked" 

i should clarify: while i personally engage in an empathetic non-violent strategy, i support [a diversity of tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_of_tactics).
