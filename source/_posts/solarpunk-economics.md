recently, i've been having conversations with my friend [Dominic Tarr](http://dominictarr.com/) about new territory we're exploring, what we might call "solarpunk economics".

i've already discovered the power of clear and refined language from the book ["Reinventing Organizations"](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/), so i'd like to share what i've uncovered so far.

## what is solarpunk economics?

in the most simple definition: solarpunk economics is to apply solarpunk values to economic practices.

by solarpunk, i mean [the harmony of society, nature, and technology](https://medium.com/solarpunks/solarpunk-a-reference-guide-8bcf18871965).

by economics, i mean [the management of our home](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/economics).

to explore our definition further, we will [sense from opposing sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic).

## opposing sides

these sides are not black and white, but rather shape a spectrum we can use as a lense.

the first side is usually preferable, however in these shades of grey we can expect exceptions.

### subjective vs objective

### earth-facing vs sky-facing

someone is earth-facing when their hopeful future is about being in communion with the ground.

someone is sky-facing when their hopeful future is about exploring space and virtual worlds.

### abundance vs scarcity

### relationships vs transactions

an interaction is transactional when it is a strictly defined reciprocal process. for example, i give you this in exchange for that. often a transaction will involve money, but not always, for example a situation where i invited you to dinner at my place so now you are expected to invite me to dinner at your place.

### resources vs capital

### intrinsic vs extrinsic

motivating for its own sake

### trust vs trustless

> don't trust. verify.

### revokable vs permanent

### voluntary vs involuntary

### fulfillment vs engagement

### agency vs individualism

agency is fractal at every level of our "self", not only the individual but also at every level of our collective organizations: the family, the village, the region, the world, the universe.

### generative vs extractive

## what are some examples?

### hitch-hiking vs uber

### couch-surfing vs airbnb

### hackerspace vs makerspace

### savings pools vs insurance

### mesh networks vs ISPs

### mentorship networks vs universities

### open source / open knowledge / open data

### potluck / clotheswap

### house parties / craft jams / art hacks

### woofing

### sports club / team / fan base

### work party (mahi)

### book group

### chore wheel

taking turns with collective responsibility

### child care

one day per week, different locations

### time banking

### platform coop
