  <section class="article-entry">
    <p>a few months ago, my co-worker Juliet planted a seed in my mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the best gift a friend can provide you is a mirror: a reflection of who you really are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i've been reflecting on who i really am, and the ways i receive more insight into who i really am.</p>
<h2>what's a mirror?</h2>
<p>a mirror is something that reflects an image of you, so you can see yourself.</p>
<p>the best mirrors are those that reflect an accurate image, without too much distortion.</p>
<p>but any mirror that allows you to see yourself from a different perspective, even when biased, is useful!</p>
<h2>seeing yourself in the mirror</h2>
<p>mirrors allow us to see ourselves in a light that is beyond our own perspectives, intuitions, and narratives.</p>
<p>in these moments, when we have an open mind and see ourselves in a new light, we are able to transform.</p>
<h2>who's that in the mirror?</h2>
<p>some years ago, i had a profound experience while seeing myself in a bathroom mirror.</p>
<p>i had found a sun dress and was wearing it for the first time at a party.</p>
<p>i went to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bathroom-mirror-selfie.jpg" alt="bathroom mirror selfie"></p>
<p>the image of me i saw in the mirror did not match the image i had for myself.</p>
<p>initially i rejected the image i saw, the person i was seeing wasn't me, i'm a <em>man</em>!</p>
<p>with time i came to accept my new image of me wearing a dress, which allowed me to construct a more inclusive identity that embodied both masculine and feminine.</p>
<h2>using other people as a mirror</h2>
<p>your friends are mirrors too!</p>
<p>your friends each have an image of you, based on their experiences and reflections.</p>
<p>a friend can share direct feedback about their image of you.</p>
<p>by receiving another's mental model of you, you can better understand who you really are and update your mental model accordingly.</p>
<p>we want our friends to provide an honest mirror, who we really are to them, not who we want to believe we are to them.</p>
<p>this gives us wider range of perspectives than we can have alone.</p>
<h3>inacurrate mirrors</h3>
<p>sometimes an inaccurate mirror is helpful because it can stimulate a gut reaction about who you really are.</p>
<p>even if it's not an accurate picture of you, it can still be useful to see yourself in a different light!</p>
<h2>using interactions as a mirror</h2>
<p>every interaction you have is a mirror!</p>
<p>you might be able to see yourself through a first impression with a stranger.</p>
<p>or maybe someone asks you something, your initial reaction is a good view into your intuition!</p>
<p>we are surrounded by mirrors... have you seen yourself lately?</p>
