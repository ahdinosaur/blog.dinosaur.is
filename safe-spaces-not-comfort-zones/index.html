    <p>some months ago, my work family Root Systems had a cultural problem:</p>
<p>our so-called <em>safe space</em> was really a <em>comfort zone</em>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>caution: my perspectives on safety and comfort are <strong>privileged</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-is-a-comfort-zone"><a href="#what-is-a-comfort-zone" class="headerlink" title="what is a comfort zone?"></a>what is a comfort zone?</h2><p>a comfort zone is where you are free from any _dis_comfort.</p>
<p>a comfort zone is where you can avoid fear, uncertainty, doubt, stress, or situational anxiety.</p>
<p>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prophet_%28book%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Prophet</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And tell me, people of Orphalese, what have you in these houses?<br>And what is it you guard with fastened doors?<br>Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power?<br>Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that span the summits of the mind?<br>Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood and stone to the holy mountain?<br>Tell me, have you these in your houses?<br>Or <strong>have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master?</strong>  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.<br>Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron.<br>It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh.<br>It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels.<br><strong>Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.</strong>  </p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-safe-space"><a href="#what-is-a-safe-space" class="headerlink" title="what is a safe space?"></a>what is a safe space?</h2><p>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe space</a> is a space where violence, harassment, or hate speech against marginalized groups is not tolerated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome or challenged on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person’s self-respect, dignity and feelings and strongly encourage everyone to respect others. - <a href="http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=607&amp;Itemid=177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advocates for Youth</a></p>

<p>a safe space is where you feel seen, where you feel heard, where you feel loved, as you are.</p>
<h2 id="safety-not-comfort"><a href="#safety-not-comfort" class="headerlink" title="safety not comfort"></a>safety not comfort</h2><p>a safe space is not always a comfort zone!</p>
<p>a safe space is where you’re safe to be vulnerable, you’re encouraged to be your authentic self, you are supported for being you.</p>
<p>even in the safest of spaces, people make mistakes, situations may become tense, conflicts may arise, work may be tough, it’s okay!</p>
<p>a safe space does not guarantee you will be free from unintended discomfort based on real challenges, but you will be free to be yourself to face those challenges!</p>

<h2 id="safe-for-who"><a href="#safe-for-who" class="headerlink" title="safe for who?"></a>safe for who?</h2><p>i notice that there is a meme floating around regarding safe spaces, with a small baby of truth amongst the dirty bathwater.</p>
<p>originally, safe spaces were created as a way to protect marginalized groups. this is a great idea!</p>
<p>however, i notice how sometimes “safe spaces” are now used as a way to punish other groups, often for mistakes due to ignorance not malice.</p>
<p>extrapolated beyond reason into an infectious narrative, this becomes “political correctness gone too far”.</p>
<p><img src="/images/safe-maga-police.jpg" alt="a safe space to make america great again"></p>
<p>but amongst the unreason, there is a small nugget of truth that people aren’t able to be themselves.</p>
<p>people don’t feel safe when they think they will be attacked for being themselves.</p>
<p>yes, this is most important for marginalized groups, where default society is not a safe space for them to be themselves.</p>
<p>this is also important for everyone, we all deserve to be our best authentic selves, even when we make mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-welcome-discomfort"><a href="#how-to-welcome-discomfort" class="headerlink" title="how to welcome discomfort"></a>how to welcome discomfort</h2><p>our comfort is a privilege, not an entitlement.</p>
<p>when we stay within our comfort zone, we enable our weaknesses at the expense of hinder personal growth.</p>
<p>paradoxically, to become a better person we want to choose to be uncomfortable, to face our fears directly.</p>
<p>to face our fears, we should be grounded in a supportive network of strength and care.</p>
<p>we won’t find our best self in our comfort zone, it will be found in the (sometimes uncomfortable) safe space!</p>
